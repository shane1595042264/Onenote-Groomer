# AI Filtering Improvements - Template Content Removal

**Date:** July 23, 2025

## Problem
The AI was stuffing massive amounts of template text and boilerplate content into Excel cells, including:
- Template field descriptions like "pricing by line: Property: GL: Auto: WC: Umbrella"
- Prompt instructions and field lists
- Email signatures and contact information
- Insurance jargon that doesn't belong in specific fields
- Content over 300+ characters that should have been "N/A"

## Root Cause
1. **Weak content filtering**: The AI was not aggressive enough in rejecting template/boilerplate text
2. **No length limits**: Responses could be unlimited length, leading to template dumps
3. **Missing template detection**: No detection of common insurance template patterns
4. **Insufficient prompt clarity**: AI prompts didn't explicitly forbid template inclusion

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `_cleanValue()` Function
**Location:** `lib/services/ollama_service.dart`

**New Features:**
- **Aggressive Boilerplate Pattern Removal**: 17 regex patterns to detect and remove common template text
- **Length Checking**: Reject responses over 200 characters or truncate intelligently  
- **Concept Counting**: If content has >3 concepts (separated by `;:|`), extract only the first meaningful part
- **Field Name Detection**: Count template field names; reject if >5 field terms detected
- **Minimum Length**: Reject responses under 3 characters

### 2. Improved AI Prompts
**Location:** `_buildPrompt()` method

**New Instructions:**
- "Provide ONLY actual values, not field descriptions or templates"
- "Do NOT include any field names, prompts, or boilerplate text"
- "Keep responses short and specific (under 50 words per field)"
- "Do NOT copy template text or field lists"

### 3. Enhanced Response Filtering
**Location:** Both response parsing methods

**New Filters:**
- Reject responses containing "specific value only", "field name", "template", "boilerplate"
- Length limit: Reject responses over 300 characters
- **Template Term Detection**: Scan for 25+ insurance template terms; reject if >2 found
- Terms include: pricing, position, technical, sic code, naics, description, etc.

### 4. Specific Boilerplate Patterns Removed
- `estimated pricing position.*?pricing justification`
- `sic code.*?naics code.*?description` 
- `mfl fire line.*?hazard grade.*?paydex score`
- `financial stress score.*?appetite.*?domiciled state`
- Email signatures with phone numbers and addresses
- Insurance jargon sequences like "pricing by line.*?property.*?gl.*?auto"

## Testing
Created test script: `testing/test_improved_ai_filtering.dart`
- Tests AI processing on sample pages
- Validates field content length and quality
- Creates test Excel file to verify improvements

## Expected Results
- **Clean Cells**: No more 300+ character template dumps
- **Relevant Content**: Only actual business values in fields
- **Appropriate N/A**: Fields with no relevant data show "N/A" instead of template text
- **Readable Output**: Excel cells contain meaningful, concise information

## Files Modified
1. `lib/services/ollama_service.dart` - Core AI filtering improvements
2. `testing/test_improved_ai_filtering.dart` - New test script

The AI should now produce clean, relevant data extraction instead of dumping template content into Excel cells! ðŸŽ¯

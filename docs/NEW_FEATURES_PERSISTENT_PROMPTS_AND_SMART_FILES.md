# üéâ NEW FEATURES: Persistent Prompts & Smart File Handling

## Overview
Two major improvements have been implemented to enhance your OneNote-to-Excel conversion experience:

1. **Persistent Custom AI Prompts** - Your customized extraction prompts are now automatically saved and restored
2. **Smart File Conflict Resolution** - No more "file locked" errors when Excel files are open

## üîÑ Feature 1: Persistent Custom AI Prompts

### What It Does
- **Automatically saves** your custom AI extraction prompt when you make changes
- **Restores your prompt** when you reopen the app on the same device
- **Uses SharedPreferences** for reliable local storage

### How It Works
- When you modify the AI prompt in the text editor, it's automatically saved
- Next time you open the app, your custom prompt is loaded from storage
- No more retyping your carefully crafted prompts!

### Technical Implementation
```dart
// Automatically saves when prompt changes
onPromptChanged: (prompt) {
  _customPrompt = prompt;
  _saveCustomPrompt(); // Auto-save
}

// Loads saved prompt on app startup
Future<void> _loadSavedPrompt() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  final savedPrompt = prefs.getString('custom_ai_prompt');
  if (savedPrompt != null) {
    setState(() {
      _customPrompt = savedPrompt;
    });
  }
}
```

## üìÅ Feature 2: Smart File Conflict Resolution

### What It Does
- **Automatically detects** when output files are locked (e.g., open in Excel)
- **Generates unique filenames** instead of trying to delete locked files
- **Preserves your data** by creating numbered versions (e.g., `file_1.xlsx`, `file_2.xlsx`)

### Problem It Solves
**Before:** 
```
Exception: Failed to write Excel file: PathAccessException: Cannot delete file...
The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process
```

**After:**
```
‚úÖ Original file exists/locked, using: June_2025_extracted_1.xlsx
‚úÖ Excel file written successfully!
```

### How It Works

#### 1. Conflict Detection
- Checks if the target file exists and is accessible
- Tests if the file can be opened for writing

#### 2. Unique Filename Generation
- Adds numbered suffixes: `filename_1.xlsx`, `filename_2.xlsx`, etc.
- Can handle up to 999 conflicts automatically
- Falls back to timestamp-based names if needed

#### 3. Multiple Strategies
```dart
// Strategy 1: Try numbered suffixes
for (int i = 1; i <= 999; i++) {
  final newFilename = '${name}_$i$extension';
  // Test if this filename is available
}

// Strategy 2: Timestamp fallback
final timestamp = DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;
final timestampFilename = '${name}_$timestamp$extension';
```

## üß™ Test Results

### File Handling Test Results
```
üß™ Testing Smart File Handling
===============================
Creating original test file: testing/test_file_handling.xlsx
‚úÖ Created original file: testing/test_file_handling.xlsx

Attempting to write to same path (should create new file)...
Original file exists/locked, using: testing\test_file_handling_1.xlsx
‚úÖ Smart file handling working! Created new file: testing\test_file_handling_1.xlsx

‚úÖ Both files exist:
   Original: testing/test_file_handling.xlsx (5091 bytes)
   New: testing\test_file_handling_1.xlsx (5094 bytes)

Testing Multiple File Conflicts...
   Conflict 1 resolved to: test_file_handling_2.xlsx
   Conflict 2 resolved to: test_file_handling_3.xlsx
   Conflict 3 resolved to: test_file_handling_4.xlsx

üéâ File handling tests completed successfully!
Features demonstrated:
‚úì Smart file conflict resolution with unique filenames
‚úì Multiple conflict handling with numbered suffixes
‚úì No more "file locked" errors when Excel files are open
```

## üöÄ User Benefits

### For Persistent Prompts
- **Time Saving**: No need to retype custom prompts
- **Consistency**: Your refined extraction rules are preserved
- **Productivity**: Focus on data processing, not setup

### For Smart File Handling
- **Zero Interruptions**: Never get blocked by locked Excel files
- **Data Safety**: All versions are preserved, nothing gets lost
- **Workflow Friendly**: Keep Excel files open while processing new data

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
```yaml
dependencies:
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2  # For persistent storage
```

### File Path Changes
The `writeExcelFile` method now returns the actual file path used:
```dart
// Before: void writeExcelFile(...)
// After: Future<String> writeExcelFile(...)

final actualPath = await excelService.writeExcelFile(
  requestedPath,
  data,
  columns
);
// actualPath might be different if conflicts were resolved
```

### Storage Location
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Roaming\[AppName]\shared_preferences\`
- **Persistent**: Survives app restarts and system reboots
- **Secure**: Local storage only, no cloud sync

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Custom Prompt Persistence
1. Open the app and modify your AI extraction prompt
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app ‚Üí Your custom prompt is automatically restored!

### Example 2: File Conflict Resolution
1. Process OneNote file ‚Üí Creates `June_2025_extracted.xlsx`
2. Open that file in Excel (keeps it locked)
3. Process another OneNote file to same path
4. App automatically creates `June_2025_extracted_1.xlsx`
5. Both files exist, no data lost!

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Template Persistence**: Save favorite Excel templates
- **Output Path Memory**: Remember last used output directories
- **Conflict Resolution UI**: Let users choose naming strategies
- **Cloud Sync**: Optional sync of prompts across devices

## üèÅ Conclusion

These features eliminate two major pain points:
1. **Repetitive prompt setup** ‚Üí Now automatic
2. **File locking errors** ‚Üí Now impossible

Your OneNote-to-Excel workflow is now smoother, more reliable, and more user-friendly than ever! üéâ

  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>From Nathan Logan:</span>
  Let?s connect and figure this one out.&nbsp; I?m seeing an older building in Highland Park ? 350 Victor Ave that could present some challenges.&nbsp; The office in Monroe, IL being non-sprinkler protected could potentially be a high NLE as well. Might be able to give them some credit if it is fully fire alarm covered and a good ISO public protection class. &nbsp;The other thing about that location is the description of Printing and Fulfillment. Sounds like that is the brochure/marketing material printing area. Probably high valued machines.&nbsp; Curious if between that and the two warehouses if there are rolled paper storage of goods and paper processing or high valued printing machines? 
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>They do direct mailing - fulfillment custom orders. </span>
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Higher values with the equipment. </span>
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Lithographic. Digital printing</span>
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Interdependency questions?</span>
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Do you have interior photos for the Valmeyer IL location? Looking to confirm if they have any fire alarms or a low exposure from a combustible load standpoint such as mostly offices?</span>
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Best Case Scenario - $7-$10M for this location.  40-60% credit of the building for smoke and stock damage. Fire department is 7.8 miles away in Waterloo. </span>
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>We can assume that Victor Ave. is pipe schedule system. If this building was not built for them it is likely not sufficient. </span>
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Hydraulic calculations for the building? </span>
  Photos of Valmeyer? Roof photos of the solar panel including spacing from roof?
  Victor Ave - Any information about the sprinkler system, was it ever updated? Are their placards? Is the entire building 
  Any prior loss control inspections or rec letters? 
  Printing and Processing, (that is okay with a pipe schedule)
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Loss Runs: Some pops but based on a $5000 AOP ded. FL wind claim was a 5% ded hence nothing paid out. </span>

  Why are you marketing the account? We asked after quoting and losing
  They through out going to with higher water damage from 25k to 50k at some locations
  AOP 10k to 25k maybe also only at select locations.
  Sanders Road - Vacant building. They have one anchor store (Convenience) They are not leasing it so that they can sell it. 
  They have the water sensors, onsite property manager, they do regular walks
  Expiring Carrier? Cinci
  Who am I competing against? They are doing a full marketing effort again; they control all the markets. US Zurich, everybody else is off on rate and values that they have never pushed past the initial conversation the past few years. Chubb is looking at it but AJG thinks they will be high. Travelers bowed out. 
  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share? 
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? Price and deductibles
  How is your submission different from the expiring program?
  Cinci is pushing values 5%, &nbsp;not sure what the rate increase will be.
  When do you need this by?
  Looking to present June 16th, need a quote by June 5
  If I meet your expectations will you move it? Yes,
  Is very transparent with pricing. Will give each carrier a last look. 
  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well?

  Named Insured schedule:
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Action Items</span>: 
  Why are you marketing the account? 
  Acrisure BORed from Marsh the account in 2023, and moved it in 2024. 
  Big struggle with underwriting terms at Citizens. &nbsp;
  Client does not like all the loss control from that carrier. Bad relationship created and Acrisure is wanting to move. No indication yet from Hanover. 
  Expiring Carrier? Hanover
  Who am I competing against? Out to several carriers, one of those is a captive option. 
  Interest from a few players. Hanover was their only option last year. Change to their underwriting team and thus there was some less 
  Some exposure in CA and regionals cannot touch that exposure. 
  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler analysis reports, etc. That you can share?
  Yes, Molly agreed to send over a summary of the issues and what has been done. Some outstanding issues, but they are in=process. 
  Corporate Control call is preferred, want to make sure there is interest on our end. 
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? 
  Use Molly as inspection contact for now. 
  How is your submission different from the expiring program?
  When do you need this by? 
  If I meet your expectations will you move it?
  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well? The WC and GL are in a Captive,
  Auto and Umbrella are outside the captive.  Auto is with Hanover, so we don't need to write it, but we can if we want. They will entertain a mono-line auto carrier. 
  Requested Commission:  Fee (net of commission)
  Current Rate is about $0.16 Was a $100,000 property premium before. 
  The values may be off.
  Requested Payment Plan: No unique special handling. They do have in-house loss control that can assist.

  ARC:
  Sprinkler adequacy ? I would change that to Sprinkler Analysis.&nbsp; 
  The other option would be also asking for the fire protection drawings.&nbsp; If they?ve added onto over the years, a contractor probably came in to perform an analysis and maybe produced some as-builts. Arvco may still have records. 
  Also please ask for recent copies of sprinkler inspection and fire pump test reports.
  Maybe add a question about what is in the IBCs in the picture?
  Last ask would be about overall systems maintenance practices ? any electrical testing/thermography, roof inspections/reports. 
  WC
  Make sure we have accurate headcount so we can compare incident rates to industry via BLS stats.
  We could also ask for 3 years of OSHA 300A summary log (it won?t have employee names, but it will show Incident and DART rate along with total hours previous year.)
  What is the story behind the amputation complaint and audit, violations, any indications on this year?s OSHA inspection etc?

  Opportunity:
  Our insured, The South Bend Clinic, LLC (SBC) is interested in quoting a standalone Property policy, effective ~5/1/25 (actual date is TBD as this would be a mid-term move).&nbsp; They recently incurred some pretty bad storm damage at three of their locations, and it?s looking like the deductible will potentially be quite hefty.&nbsp; We are hoping to obtain some quotes to look to move their coverage to a carrier that may be able to offer lower cat deductibles than what they currently have.&nbsp; Following is what we are hoping to find:
  We are not ?stuck? on those deductibles, but these mirror the deductibles they had on their individual policy a few years ago before they joined our larger group that is currently providing their coverage.&nbsp; Essentially, we?d be looking for as low of a deductible as possible.
  Attached is their current SOV.&nbsp; I have also attached the loss runs on file.&nbsp; Note, they are currently part of a larger group master policy.&nbsp; As you will see per the SOV, all of their locations are in IN, so the losses listed do not apply to SBC.&nbsp; If you can quote, then we can obtain updated / current loss runs.
  We have a meeting with them on Thursday 4/24, so I apologize for the short notice, but if there?s any way to provide a general ballpark indication in the next few days, then it would be very greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Very sorry for the short notice, but we just received the preliminary deductible info from the claims adjustor a couple of days ago, and with the meeting looming next week, we are hoping to prepare some future alternatives with lower deductibles.&nbsp; If that?s not enough time, then we?d still love to see a quote when you can provide one.
  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if additional info is needed.

  Why are you marketing the account? Insured got hit with a high wind retention and thinks they want to pay more for better coverage.
  Should the first named insured be The South Bend Clinic LLC or DuPage Medical Group, Ltd.?  FNI should be The South Bend Clinic, LLC (aka SBC).  DuPage Medical is the parent company and is the NI on their current policy, but we are looking to split off the coverage for SBC. 
  Are you able to provide an ACORD application and 5-10 years of loss runs? Loss runs attached going back to 2021 when we began insuring them.  We can provide reports for the terms prior upon binding as needed, but since we were not their agent before 2021, the prior info is not readily available.  For the loss runs, please note that none of the claims apply to SBC as their locations are all in Indiana.  However, they do have an open claim for recent storm damage that was incurred ~3/31.  We can provide additional details as the cost of the claim becomes known ? we are still in the very early stages at this point, and the carrier is still unsure if the damages will exceed the deductible. This report was run before the current claim was reported.
  Unfortunately, since they are currently part of the larger group policy, we don?t really have an Acord app specific to SBC.
  What is their current deductible structure for AOP/CAT 
  ? AOP $25k
  ? Wind/Hail 3%/min $250k
  ? Flood $100k 
  ? Water Damage $175k
  Expiring Carrier? Liberty Mutual

  Ultimately, they are projecting about the exact same exposures as they were last year.&nbsp; The only figures that may change from this is the business income as we have acquired a company that employs a team of forensic accountants who are combing through this file as we speak to come up with a more accurate number.&nbsp; As soon as we have that update I will share with you but for the time being please use the amounts on this workbook.
  This account has been with Travelers for a handful of years and while historically they have been happy with Travelers, they were upset that the wind/hail jumped to 2% at last years renewal.&nbsp; They also have a new CFO as the previous one retired so there is no real relationship between Travelers and the current buyer.&nbsp; That said, they aren?t necessarily looking to move it just to move it but if it makes sense from a premium and/or coverage (deductible) standpoint we will encourage them to move.
  The effective date is 6-1, however, the insured asked for quotes by 5-1.&nbsp; We told him due to the likelihood that most or all of these properties have to be pre-inspected that 5-1 is an aggressive target.&nbsp; So we have some room to work with in regards to the need by date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion would be to model this internally and see if you think you can achieve the premiums/and or deductibles.&nbsp; At that point, If it is worth setting up inspections we can then go that route. &nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a different plan, I am open to any and all suggestions. 
  Target Premiums &amp; Deductibles Are as Follows:
  Property (Including Equipment Breakdown): $445,000-$455,000 ($100K AOP) ($100K Wind/Hail Deductible preferred ? $250K or 1% if that is not possible)
  General Liability: $51,000
  Workers Compensation: $150,000
  Commercial Auto: $15,000
  $10MM Umbrella: $33,000

  Have you looked into a wind buydown? We have, but it was just trading dollars. 
  Why are you marketing the account? Not married to Travelers. Looking to reduce the wind hail deductible. 
  Expiring Carrier? Travelers
  Who am I competing against? Travelers. Zurich, Hartford and Chubb. There is competition. 
  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share?
  Travelers has 30 open recs.  28 advisory recs. 
  Two important recs have been closed out. 
  Should have that update soon. Week of April 11.
  Not looking at stock throughputs but are valuing stock at selling price. 
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? Wind Deductible; 
  How is your submission different from the expiring program?  Values have increased and should be sufficient. Disaster Recovery Services (forensic accounts) who help with BI worksheets and such. So those are forthcoming.
  When do you need this by? 05/01 is the date that they gave them. But agreed that this is unrealistic. 05/11 is more realistic. 
  If I meet your expectations will you move it? Yeah, but if Hub recommends us they will likely listen to them.
  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well?

Water Damage Deductibles - Allianz lost in 2023.
Coming off; 18-month term from Travelers eff 06/01/2025
<span
style='font-weight:bold'>Action Items</span>: 
Why are you marketing the account? 
Expiring Carrier? Travelers is taking 2-3% rate and 2-3% exposures.
A few other carriers are looking at it; 
They have a split program; Travelers on the property
The Racino and the Casino looking to combine onto one program. 
Casualty
(Racino is with American Specialty - Arch)
Casino - Travelers writes the casualty separately. Ground up $7500 ded. 
$1M water damage push by Allianz (acknowledged our coverage was better and our rate was better) but 
$100,000
$10M umbrella over the Racino
Auto, WC, $1M umbrella from Travelers (then High Excess above the $10M) They carry $130M of liability (distinguished handles $65M of the tower in the middle. 
Who am I competing against?
Travelers was higher in terms of rate. But they did not want the big deductible. 
Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share?
What are the issues that can drive the account to move?
How is your submission different from the expiring program?
When do you need this by?
If I meet your expectations will you move it?
Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well?

  Opportunity:
  Back in 2020 the insured had a large CAT property loss that led to a non-renewal notice from Cincinnati Insurance. &nbsp;See attached Cincinnati loss runs. &nbsp;Their agent moved them from Cincinnati to Travelers.&nbsp; At that time, the insured took a significant property rate increase.&nbsp; Therefore, our primary pain point is premium&nbsp; However, as I dug into the replacement cost estimator, I appears to be the Elgin building is overvalued.&nbsp; Therefore, to reduce the premium we don?t necessarily need to slash the rate.&nbsp; It could be achieved by a combination of building value and a moderate rate reduction. Our target combined property rate is .11
  Travelers is the incumbent with a 6/9/24 to 6/9/25 policy term.&nbsp; The insured is motivated to move and has requested we quote midterm. Our target effective date is 1/22/24
  Is this something you can consider on a monoline property basis? &nbsp;Internally, we recognized we need to gather a significant amount of underwriting data on the casualty lines.&nbsp; Therefore, our approach has somewhat shifted over to monoline property.&nbsp; If we are successful in obtaining an appealing property program, we?ll have the creditability we need to ask for all the additional casualty information.

  Initially the ask was to market the property since they had taken on a large rate increase. 
  Cinci was on the building and had a large loss, They non-renewed - Cat loss over $1M
  Went to Travelers for more rate. 
  2019 was the large loss. 
  Really competitive property only quote. So

  Sprinkler adequacy ? I would change that to Sprinkler Analysis.&nbsp; 
  The other option would be also asking for the fire protection drawings.&nbsp; If they?ve added onto over the years, a contractor probably came in to perform an analysis and maybe produced some as-builts. Arvco may still have records. 
  Also please ask for recent copies of sprinkler inspection and fire pump test reports.
  Maybe add a question about what is in the IBCs in the picture?
  Last ask would be about overall systems maintenance practices ? any electrical testing/thermography, roof inspections/reports. 
  WC
  Make sure we have accurate headcount so we can compare incident rates to industry via BLS stats.
  We could also ask for 3 years of OSHA 300A summary log (it won?t have employee names, but it will show Incident and DART rate along with total hours previous year.)
  What is the story behind the amputation complaint and audit, violations, any indications on this year?s OSHA inspection etc?

  Apologies for the delay here. The incumbent did end up coming back with a big rate concession and the insured was in agreement to shut down marketing this year. Very sorry for any work you have done so far, but hopefully I am catching this prior to too much leg work. Give me a ring if you want to discuss

Is there anything else broker had available for us to help vet it?
Does Travelers do the full foreign now? &nbsp;Yes, so if we cannot it might; 
This was prob written back when corporate Allianz prop did 100% global programs. I doubt we can get our old reports unfortunately from arc net. We should ask for in case from broker and our people as I bet they were well written. 
I am a smidge worried about the sprk and hydraulic recs at 21<span
style='vertical-align:super'>st</span> St in Racine WI. Doesn?t say how big that area is. &nbsp;You can see where the wooden roof area in center of plant and I swear that is where the racking is underneath from that pic. Could be nle=mfl. We also don?t know how bad the IBC situation is. The recs are 2 yr old and all open. &nbsp;And again, hard to know what the combustible loading &nbsp;could be. Tough. Exterior looks well maintained. 
1328 Racine St ? 1918 yr built ? if schedule pipe system, prob can?t handle the warehousing if tougher commodities. Plus, it?s combustible construction in certain areas. &nbsp;Wonder if they did any upgrades at all.  
Same sprk inadequacy type rec mentioned in Sturtevant Wi. Hard to gauge what that means and how the loading is w/ the little info available. 
TX has no sprinklers. &nbsp;So those are prob 100% NLE unless combustible loading is real low. - 
Largest 
Australia looks sprinklers and decent from google exterior. Think I see sprk pipes.  
Singapore looks less than idea ? area is very crowded ? and right by the ocean - 
Italy ? sounds like roof is combustible ? weird half circles - 
Switzerland ? doesn?t look bad but roof shows staining - Liam will follow up. 
I see recs for Belgium from Travelers &nbsp;but it?s no on SOV? Odd?.. Was deleted off this year.

  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share? None, 
  Security is first party now at some locations (instead of third-party)
  One location has requested specialized additional security for (under a contract, not their lease)
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move?
  Additional Loss Control services
  Claims Services maybe (based on the frequency)
  How is your submission different from the expiring program?
  BRP values were adjusted last year. This year seems like they have not been adjusted. They might need a little tweaking. BI exposures have been updated for 2025-2026&nbsp;
  When do you need this by? Sooner is better, but looking to propose by Mid-May 
  If I meet your expectations will you move it? 
  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well?

  Opportunity:
  This is an 82-story building in Chicago, IL that was completed in 2009.&nbsp; The condo portion of risk is on floors 53 ? 82 and contains 262 units with deeded parking.&nbsp;&nbsp; The building also includes townhomes - located at the base of structure, a hotel, and apartments. Each entity is owned and insured separately with an Easement agreement in place requiring property coverage insured by the same carrier ? all portions of risk will need to be considered to move forward. I will send a separate submission for Parkhomes at Aqua Condominium Association, which is the Townhomes.&nbsp; Dan Kinney will handle sending out the hotel &amp; apartments submissions.
  Current insurance program is with Chubb &amp; expiring building limit for the Aqua Condo is $141,489,000.&nbsp; Because this is a bare walls building, we?ve had difficultly determining accurate replacement cost to apply toward the condo.&nbsp; Per our recommendation, the board agreed to complete an Insurance Appraisal at the end of 2023 and we discovered a large increase in value is needed.&nbsp; To help the association budget for unexpected valuation expenses, we?re requesting 2 quote options using different policy limits. $218,500,000 is the amount reflected in attached report and $185,000,000 is slightly over 80% of appraised value.&nbsp; Acord App, Easement Agreement, Loss run &amp; program loss summary are also attached, please let me know if there is anything additional needed or questions you?d like to further discuss.

Decline for QSG
Thanks, is CNA using the 5% named storm and $25M sub-limit for named storm? Are you getting a buydown now? 100% Texas is going to be a tough sell on my end. 
Any chance to write the auto or the comp? The GL is likely in a program and not something we can do. If there is a massive fleet schedule the auto might not make sense, but if I can package this that would help my chances of quoting. 
Let me know on loss control information as soon as you can.

  Why are you marketing the account?  Most of the program is with CNA for several years. 
  PL &amp; GL was declined by ARCH. 
  Expiring Carrier? CNA, 
  Who am I competing against? Liberty is looking at it. Some are stand-alone only like Zurich, Casualty is tough and the FL wind is tough. Travelers is very interested, but can't do a lot of the FL stuff. 
  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share? None
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? CAT Limits and rate. 
  How is your submission different from the expiring program? No changes
  When do you need this by? 05/05/2025
  If I meet your expectations will you move it? Unclear, seems like they are just looking for quotes to get CNA to lower their rate at renewal and not really interested in moving the account. 
  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well? PL and GL, Auto, WC, Umbrella,

  This entire account is going to move to 10/23. 
  If it is best to focus on that date, totally understand. The primary focus is around the Harmon CTH LLC asset. I would love to move it all but given the timing, I?m focused on this asset because it is a 7/2 renewal.
  Let me know if you have any additional questions. I?ve got a call with the client tomorrow to get more clarity around what the tenant is doing at the assets.

  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Action Items</span>: 
  Why are you marketing the account?  
  Does not need to be mono-line property, but the property is the pain point, 
  The program
  Finished inventory that is out in the open and currently a different program. 
  The pain is on the Shared and Layered program.,$20M loss limit. Deductible is $500,000 
  Steel buildings. 
  Expiring Carrier? Convex and Kinsale and Great Lakes share the primary $10M
  Who am I competing against? 
  Travelers is looking at it and a lot of work has been done to get the trailer submission (this one)
  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share?
  Broker has offered to coordinate loss control for us. 
  No, anything that we would want. Starr, Sompo, Everest they all ask the same thing but nothing available. 
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move?
  Casualty is with Marsh in a program. 
  Comp is with Sentry
  Other lines with various carriers. 
  Not buying BI coverage. 
  High retention strategy. These guys have a lot of liquid cash. They do around $500M in revenue. High volume account. Lots of redudancy. 
  How is your submission different from the expiring program?
  When do you need this by?
  If I meet your expectations will you move it?
  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well?
  Requested Commission: 15%
  Requested Payment Plan: Tend to be on Annual pay since they are in the wholesale market. 
  Hylant does a quarterly claim review with them. 
  Property frequency is low. <br>
Lots of WC claims and thus that is a big need. 
  Roughly a $.40 to $0.50 rate in the shared and layered E*S market. Some significant TIV changes expected. 
  So premium maybe more, but willing to accept a lower loss limit.

style='font-weight:bold'>Industry Group</span>: Real Estate
  Named Insured schedule:
  LONG - 
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Action Items</span>: 
  Why are you marketing the account? Last years renewal was very rocky. In the past Wayla was not involved. There is a construction side and a real estate side. They are working to split these exposures into two programs. 
  Auto is vehicles driven by property manager(s)
  WC is property managers 
  Construction is being marketed to markets to specialize in construction. 
  Expiring Carrier? C N A 
  The property has its own policy now (composite rate previously, then moved to location based rating) This new way is a problem for them since they do not fully own every location and those by location costs are being passed on, so the revised premium allocation caused a huge headache which prompted them to market this again this year. 
  So from a property standpoint the schedule is some Midwest, TX, MO, FL. 
  FL has full limits. 
  Every property is applied a unique deductible. 
  They do place a deductible buy-down
  Who am I competing against?  
  Full marketing effort again this year. 
  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share? 
  No issues with Recs. They have gotten rec letters and those issues have been complied with.
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? 
  Real Estate Property on a stand-alone basis. 
  If they break it up with the plan to move everything. 
  Construction side has several markets interested. 
  Real Estate side, at this moment a couple carriers are interested in Mono-line Property, GL is the next piece. 
  Per Wayla, the insured will not be marketed every year going forward. 
  The client has not had a comfort level. 
  How is your submission different from the expiring program?
  Only the real estate side of things. 
  Some properties were deleted at year end. So values are supposed to have been adjusted up. 
  MMA did ERCs on the whole schedule. 
  Only changes 24-25 to 25-26 were the rents that increased 3-5%. 
  When do you need this by? 05.21 but they are willing to be flexible. 
  If I meet your expectations will you move it? They have no qualms about moving carriers. 
  They have a fifteen year relationship but that?s not an issue for them. They believe CNA is taking advantage of them by ticking up rates year over year.  
  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well? 
  They do have Executive Risk exposure and that is with the executive risk team to market. 
  Requested Commission: 0% Net of Commission
  Requested Payment Plan: Normal Typical Vanilla 
  Agency Monthly
  No claims coding
  No assumption that we will risk control every year 
  Expiring premium on the real Estate GL is $86,443
  That equates out to $47 rate per sqaure foot

  Target:
  Average Rate was a $0.21 rate for the portfolio - OH was getting 9-12 cents and FL 50-70 cents which 
  $0.21 did not change much from expiring, but may have went down some. 
  They pulled off some of the higher rated locations.

style='font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline'>DESCRIPTION OF EXCHANGE BUILDING:</span>
  The Exchange is Seattle?s premier art-deco building, built in 1930 located at 821 2nd Avenue Seattle, WA 98104. The Exchange was designed by the John Graham Company to house the Seattle Stock Exchange. Today, this iconic building has been modernized to support some of the most innovative companies.
  <span
style='font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline'>BUILDING UPGRADE:</span>
  Circa 2015 the building underwent a comprehensive seismic upgrade. The upgrade was designed for the 225 year (20% exceedance in 50 years) earthquake. This is equivalent to a BSE-1E hazard level for existing building as defined in ASCE-41-13. The work included adding six full height shear walls on the inside of exterior walls to the 19th floor. Nine other shear walls were added. Seven of these were for the 19th floor to the roof, accommodating the vertical setbacks. The new shear panels were reinforced concrete, applied as shotcrete. The new reinforcing was doweled to the existing concrete columns and beams. Selected areas of the floor were upgraded, presumably to increase the capacity of the horizontal diaphragms. Selected beams also were retrofitted.

Asked Stephanie if she even wanted to support writing the property this year. 
  <span

  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>AIRE Initial Review</span>
  Some property thoughts are below. I know Adam is looking at the other lines, and I?m happy to loop in Mike Spence if you need anything else on that (a number of the properties appear to have swimming pools, etc.), I just figured I would take care of what I can?
  I was able to find flood reviews in ArcNet for 4 of the locations, and I looked up the other 2 myself. Brief notes are in the attached modified SOV.
  In short, we are certainly looking at a flood exposure at the Lincolnshire Marriott (10 Marriott Drive, Lincolnshire, IL) ? the flood zone skirts the exterior part of this building, and ArcOps developed flood LE?s of $1,022,906 for the 100-yr event and $1,719,129 for the 500-yr event.
  The other potential flood exposure is in Northbrook, IL (933 Skokie Blvd). Per ArcOps review, FEMA maps indicate there is no flood exposure here, but CATLAS identifies a flood exposure, so ArcOps developed flood LE?s of $1,788,889 for the 100-yr event and $2,666,666 for the 500-yr event. I have a message out to our team, and plan to discuss this further with Steve Hanly or another flood specialist, because it?s not the first time I?ve run into a situation where FEMA says we?re safe by multiple feet but CATLAS says we?re underwater. I?m not sure if you have a standard approach to this, but it also doesn?t help that my CATLAS isn?t working right now, so I?m not able to perform that analysis myself. There does appear to be a basement, so that could be impacting the LE. I will get back to you ASAP on this exposure, but for now let?s assume that the current LE?s listed above (~$1.7 M and $2.6 M) are correct.
  With regards to a servicing plan for this account, the only potential pre-bind survey would be to the Lincolnshire location (10 Marriott Drive, Lincolnshire, IL), mainly to validate sprinkler coverage. We could also potentially take care of this with an email, but either way, I?m looking at some photos online of that property, and I don?t see sprinklers in a number of the photos. It?s possible that they are outdated, or that the photos have been edited to remove sprinklers (a surprisingly common occurrence), but I?m seeing enough photos without sprinklers that I want to validate the reported ?100% sprinklered? from the SOV.
  Post-bind, I think the ?Light Hazard? survey ordering guidelines would be appropriate:
  I?ll get back to you ASAP regarding flood exposure in Northbrook, IL, but if you need anything else in the meantime, please let me know.

  Sprinkler adequacy ? I would change that to Sprinkler Analysis.&nbsp; 
  The other option would be also asking for the fire protection drawings.&nbsp; If they?ve added onto over the years, a contractor probably came in to perform an analysis and maybe produced some as-builts. Arvco may still have records. 
  Also please ask for recent copies of sprinkler inspection and fire pump test reports.
  Maybe add a question about what is in the IBCs in the picture?
  Last ask would be about overall systems maintenance practices ? any electrical testing/thermography, roof inspections/reports. 
  WC
  Make sure we have accurate headcount so we can compare incident rates to industry via BLS stats.
  We could also ask for 3 years of OSHA 300A summary log (it won?t have employee names, but it will show Incident and DART rate along with total hours previous year.)
  What is the story behind the amputation complaint and audit, violations, any indications on this year?s OSHA inspection etc?
  Any safety culture initiatives
  Employee performance reviews (and does that include management)
  Incentive programs
  Dedicated safety director
  Safety committee
  Self-audits (general facilities, machine guarding, etc)
  Safety program, training records
  Light duty/return to work program
  Drug free workplace program

  FIKE - Fire Suppression System. They have a system that prevents losses in machines. Pressure drop right before a spark and an explosion. This system activates and extinguishes any fire hazard.

  Named Insured schedule: 
  <span
style='font-weight:bold'>Action Items</span>: 
  Why are you marketing the account? 
  They ended up on a layered program
  AXA takes the first layer
  With 7 layers above to the total TIV
  Expiring Carrier? AXA Takes the first layer
  Who am I competing against? AXA, Travelers is looking at it this year. AFM has looked at it, AFM did a report and inspection which took two days. AFM did not release their report. Marsh engineering is going to go out and share that report. 
  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share? No, 
  There are five buildings all built into one plant, no second plant. So there is some fire walls and protections put in to prevent a total loss. 
  Doubts that the insured will install in-rack sprinklers. They will just reprogram their pallets to provide ample space. 
  Main core in the HVAC system they have a kill switch which will stop airflow and smoke from spreading. They have a shed with a kill switch for the HVAC
  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? Looking to move back to a guaranteed cost program. Last year was the first year they have not been able to get a guaranteed cost program put together. Mitsui was on it for the loss and exited the market (left America for non-reverse flow accounts). Sompo had it for two years. Berkley wrote it for one year but then lost their fac on the property. Berkley still has the casualty. 
  Sompo did not want it back based on the high density rack storage issue. 
  GL and Auto is with Berkley.
  WC is on a loss sensitive program with a captive.
  Umbrella - Berkley 2-5 and excess of $15M
  How is your submission different from the expiring program? 
  When do you need this by? Owner never sleeps. Early October. 
  If I meet your expectations will you move it?

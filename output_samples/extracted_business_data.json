Might be able to give them some credit if it is fully fire alarm covered and a good ISO public protection class. \u0026nbsp;The other thing about that location is the description of Printing and Fulfillment.

We can provide reports for the terms prior upon binding as needed, but since we were not their agent before 2021, the prior info is not readily available.  For the loss runs, please note that none of the claims apply to SBC as their locations are all in Indiana.  However, they do have an open claim for recent storm damage that was incurred ~3/31.

Last years renewal was very rocky. In the past Wayla was not involved. There is a construction side and a real estate side. They are working to split these exposures into two programs. \n  Auto is vehicles driven by property manager(s)\n  WC is property managers \n  Construction is being marketed to markets to specialize in construction. \n  Expiring Carrier? C N A \n  The property has its own policy now (composite rate previously, then moved to location based rating) This new way is a problem for them since they do not fully own every location and those by location costs are being passed on, so the revised premium allocation caused a huge headache which prompted them to market this again this year. \n  So from a property standpoint the schedule is some Midwest, TX, MO, FL. \n  FL has full limits. \n  Every property is applied a unique deductible. \n  They do place a deductible buy-down\n  Who am I competing against?  \n  Full marketing effort again this year. \n  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share? \n  No issues with Recs. They have gotten rec letters and those issues have been complied with.\n  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? \n  Real Estate Property on a stand-alone basis. \n  If they break it up with the plan to move everything. \n  Construction side has several markets interested. \n  Real Estate side, at this moment a couple carriers are interested in Mono-line Property, GL is the next piece. \n  Per Wayla, the insured will not be marketed every year going forward. \n  The client has not had a comfort level. \n  How is your submission different from the expiring program?\n  Only the real estate side of things. \n  Some properties were deleted at year end. So values are supposed to have been adjusted up. \n  MMA did ERCs on the whole schedule. \n  Only changes 24-25 to 25-26 were the rents that increased 3-5%. \n  When do you need this by? 05.21 but they are willing to be flexible. \n  If I meet your expectations will you move it? They have no qualms about moving carriers. \n  They have a fifteen year relationship but that’s not an issue for them. They believe CNA is taking advantage of them by ticking up rates year over year.  \n  Where are the other products and can I compete on them as well? \n  They do have Executive Risk exposure and that is with the executive risk team to market. \n  Requested Commission: 0% Net of Commission\n  Requested Payment Plan: Normal Typical Vanilla \n  Agency Monthly\n  No claims coding\n  No assumption that we will risk control every year \n  Expiring premium on the real Estate GL is $86,443\n  That equates out to $47 rate per sqaure foot\n  EXPOSURES:\n  CONTROLS:\n  Other:\n  Do they want Terrorism Coverage: \n  Is it in Tier 1 or Tier 2 locations?\n  Any referral triggers due to CAT?\n  Severe or High Risk Hail:\n  Quake\n  Flood\n  Wildfire\n  Terrorism\n  Open Recs/Prior Loss Control Actions/Recommendations: \n  Risk Solutions Grade: \n  RS ROE: \n  Loss History: \n  Expiring Pricing:\u0026nbsp;\n  $\n  Target:\n  Average Rate was a $0.21 rate for the portfolio - OH was getting 9-12 cents and FL 50-70 cents which \n  $0.21 did not change much from expiring, but may have went down some. \n  They pulled off some of the higher rated locations.\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eEstimated Pricing Position - $\u003c/span\u003e\n  Pricing by Line:\n  Property:\n  GL:\n  Auto:\n  WC:\n  Umbrella:\n  Technical Price: \n  Does it make since at that price:\n  If not, why should we deviate:\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eTarget Price\u003c/span\u003e: \n  Pricing Justification:\n  Class Fit: \n  SIC CODE: \n  ISO GL CODE(s): \n  WC CODE(s): \n  AUTO:\n  \u0026nbsp; H\u0026amp;NO Only: \n  \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Cost of Hire:\n  \u0026nbsp; # of drivers:\n  \u0026nbsp; # of vehicles:\n  Is it in appetite: \n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eSecondary Notepad:\u003c/span\u003e\n  PHOTOS:\n  \u003cbr\u003e\nHospitals/Medical:\n  Answers to the following questions:\n  \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\n  GL\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n  Property\n  Risk Transfer\n  Please provide answers/evidence of the risk management and risk transfer controls that the applicant has in place.\n  Specifically in regards to GL Risk Transfer Controls:\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eReason(s) for placing LOB in different Company if deviating: \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eUnderwriter Documentation: \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eGeneral Information - Commercial\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eDoes this accurately reflect the operations?\u003c/span\u003e\n  Description of Operations: \n  New Business Opportunity/Renewal Strategy:",

The Exchange was designed by the John Graham Company to house the Seattle Stock Exchange. Today, this iconic building has been modernized to support some of the most innovative companies.\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline\u0027\u003eBUILDING UPGRADE:\u003c/span\u003e\n  Circa 2015 the building underwent a comprehensive seismic upgrade. The upgrade was designed for the 225 year (20% exceedance in 50 years) earthquake. This is equivalent to a BSE-1E hazard level for existing building as defined in ASCE-41-13. The work included adding six full height shear walls on the inside of exterior walls to the 19th floor. Nine other shear walls were added. Seven of these were for the 19th floor to the roof, accommodating the vertical setbacks. The new shear panels were reinforced concrete, applied as shotcrete. The new reinforcing was doweled to the existing concrete columns and beams. Selected areas of the floor were upgraded, presumably to increase the capacity of the horizontal diaphragms. Selected beams also were retrofitted.\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;font-style:italic\u0027\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline\u0027\u003eSUBMISSION DOCUMENTS:\u003c/span\u003e\n  Attached are the following documents to assist your underwriting review:\n  Statement of Insurable Values Workbook\n  6-Year Loss History \n  Engineering Report\n  Below is a summary of the Key Policy Terms we are seeking for the upcoming renewal:\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline\u0027\u003eKEY PROGRAM LIMITS: \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline\u0027\u003eKEY PROGRAM DEDUCTIBLES\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-style:italic\u0027\u003e: \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline\u0027\u003eQUOTE DUE DATE: Tuesday, July 8\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;vertical-align:super\u0027\u003eth\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline\u0027\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\n  We will be in touch soon to discuss – in the meantime, please let us know if any questions or additional information needed.

I know Adam is looking at the other lines, and I’m happy to loop in Mike Spence if you need anything else on that (a number of the properties appear to have swimming pools, etc.), I just figured I would take care of what I can…\n  I was able to find flood reviews in ArcNet for 4 of the locations, and I looked up the other 2 myself. Brief notes are in the attached modified SOV.\n  In short, we are certainly looking at a flood exposure at the Lincolnshire Marriott (10 Marriott Drive, Lincolnshire, IL) – the flood zone skirts the exterior part of this building, and ArcOps developed flood LE’s of $1,022,906 for the 100-yr event and $1,719,129 for the 500-yr event.\n  The other potential flood exposure is in Northbrook, IL (933 Skokie Blvd). Per ArcOps review, FEMA maps indicate there is no flood exposure here, but CATLAS identifies a flood exposure, so ArcOps developed flood LE’s of $1,788,889 for the 100-yr event and $2,666,666 for the 500-yr event. I have a message out to our team, and plan to discuss this further with Steve Hanly or another flood specialist, because it’s not the first time I’ve run into a situation where FEMA says we’re safe by multiple feet but CATLAS says we’re underwater. I’m not sure if you have a standard approach to this, but it also doesn’t help that my CATLAS isn’t working right now, so I’m not able to perform that analysis myself. There does appear to be a basement, so that could be impacting the LE. I will get back to you ASAP on this exposure, but for now let’s assume that the current LE’s listed above (~$1.7 M and $2.6 M) are correct.\n  With regards to a servicing plan for this account, the only potential pre-bind survey would be to the Lincolnshire location (10 Marriott Drive, Lincolnshire, IL), mainly to validate sprinkler coverage. We could also potentially take care of this with an email, but either way, I’m looking at some photos online of that property, and I don’t see sprinklers in a number of the photos. It’s possible that they are outdated, or that the photos have been edited to remove sprinklers (a surprisingly common occurrence), but I’m seeing enough photos without sprinklers that I want to validate the reported “100% sprinklered” from the SOV.\n  Post-bind, I think the “Light Hazard” survey ordering guidelines would be appropriate:\n  I’ll get back to you ASAP regarding flood exposure in Northbrook, IL, but if you need anything else in the meantime, please let me know.\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eConfirmation of 100% sprinkler protection for Lincolnshire\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eLoss Runs: \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eEffective Date\u003c/span\u003e: \u0026nbsp;08/18\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eClass Fit \u003c/span\u003e\n  SIC CODE: \n  NAICS Code / Description:\u0026nbsp; \n  MFL Fire Line / Hazard Grade:\n  Paydex Score:\n  Financial Stress Score:\n  Appetite:\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eDomiciled State: \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eAncillary States: \u003c/span\u003e\n  Opportunity:\n  Prior Submissions:\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eNeed by Date\u003c/span\u003e: \n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eQuoted Date: \u003c/span\u003e\n  Subjectivities/Due Dates:\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eDescription of Operations\u003c/span\u003e:\u0026nbsp;\n  What they do: \n  What they do not do: \n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eBroker\u003c/span\u003e: Nick Albrecht\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eIndustry Group\u003c/span\u003e: \n  Named Insured schedule:\n  \u003cspan\nstyle=\u0027font-weight:bold\u0027\u003eAction Items\u003c/span\u003e: \n  Why are you marketing the account? \n  Expiring Carrier?

AFM did not release their report. Marsh engineering is going to go out and share that report. \n  Do you have any current loss control reports such as rec letters, sprinkler adequacy reports, etc. That you can share? No, \n  There are five buildings all built into one plant, no second plant. So there is some fire walls and protections put in to prevent a total loss. \n  Doubts that the insured will install in-rack sprinklers. They will just reprogram their pallets to provide ample space. \n  Main core in the HVAC system they have a kill switch which will stop airflow and smoke from spreading. They have a shed with a kill switch for the HVAC\n  What are the issues that can drive the account to move? Looking to move back to a guaranteed cost program. Last year was the first year they have not been able to get a guaranteed cost program put together. Mitsui was on it for the loss and exited the market (left America for non-reverse flow accounts). Sompo had it for two years. Berkley wrote it for one year but then lost their fac on the property. Berkley still has the casualty. \n  Sompo did not want it back based on the high density rack storage issue. \n  GL and Auto is with Berkley.\n  WC is on a loss sensitive program with a captive.\n  Umbrella - Berkley 2-5 and excess of $15M\n  How is your submission different from the expiring program? \n  When do you need this by?
